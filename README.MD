- This tool <u>only replaces</u> HTML(text) component.
- This script is only tested with 1 edX course. Therefore, unexpected error should happen while using the program. 
- There is a bug after uploading course back to edX. It is found that some text components disappeared in edX page. In our test, 1 component is missing.
- Some HTML component listed in ‘error_files.txt’ will not have figures showed properly in edX. This happens when original component (Eng) and translated component (local language) have different number of figures
